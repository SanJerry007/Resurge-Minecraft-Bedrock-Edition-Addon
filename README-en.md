*Resurge* is an open-source addon currently under development for Minecraft Bedrock Edition (MC-BE). Its primary objective is to enhance the player's adventure by introducing a more challenging and thrilling gameplay experience. The key feature of *Resurge* revolves around the concept of mob rejuvenation upon their demise. Mobs may revive in a more formidable state, attract the attention of their fellow creatures, or retaliate with a death effect against their attackers, among other possibilities. Furthermore, this addon will introduce various variations to most hostile mobs and craft captivating storylines based on their transformations.

**Feel free to give any suggestions or customize the pack with your own creative ideas.**
